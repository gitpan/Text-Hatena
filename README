NAME
    Text::Hatena - Perl extension for formatting text with Hatena Style.

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::Hatena;

      my $parser = Text::Hatena->new(
        permalink => 'http://www.example.com/entry/123',
      );
      $parser->parse($text);
      my $html = $parser->html;

DESCRIPTION
    Text::Hatena parses text with Hatena Style and generates html string.
    Hatena Style is a set of text syntax which is originally used in Hatena
    Diary (http://d.hatena.ne.jp/).

    You can get html string from simple text with syntax like Wiki.

METHODS
    Here are common methods of Text::Hatena.

    new
          $parser = Text::Hatena->new;
          $parser = Text::Hatena->new(
            permalink => 'http://www.example.com/entry/123',
            ilevel => 1,
            invalidnode => [qw(h4 h5)],
            sectionanchor => '@',
          );

        creates an instance of Text::Hatena.

        "permalink" is the uri of your document. It is used in H3 section
        anchor.

        "ilevel" is the base indent level.

        "invalidnode" is an array reference of invalid nodes. The node in
        the array will be skipped.

        "sectionanchor" is the string of H3 section anchor.

    parse
          $parser->parse($text);

        parses text and generates html.

    html
          $html = $parser->html;

        returns html string generated.

Text::Hatena Syntax
    Text::Hatena supports some simple markup language, which is similar to
    the Wiki format.

    Paragraphs
        Basically each line becomes a paragraph. If you want to force a
        newline in a paragraph, you can use a line break markup of HTML.

        You can add footnotes by using double parentheses.

          Hatena is in Tokyo((The biggest city in Japan)).

        Text::Hatena treats a blank line as the end of a block. A blank line
        after a paragraph does not affect the output. Two blank lines are
        translated into a line break, three blank lines are translated into
        two line breaks and so on.

        To stop generating paragraphs automatically, start a line with ><
        (greater-than sign and less-than sign). The first > (greater-than
        sign) will be omitted. If you end a line with ><, it will stop. The
        last < (less-than sign) will be omitted.

          ><div class="foo">A div block without paragraph.</div><

          ><form action="foo.cgi" method="put">
          To insert a from, write as you see here.
          <input type="text" name="a" />
          <input type="submit" />
          </form><

    Headlines
        To create a section headline, start a line with a star followed by
        an anchor, a star, some tags of categories and a section title. An
        anchor and tags are optional. If you omit an anchor, Text::Hatena
        generates it automatically.

          *A line with a star becomes section headline
          *sa*You can specify a string for anchor name
          *[foo][bar]You can specify some tags of categories
          *sa*[foo][bar]You can mix them

        More stars mean deeper levels of headlines. You can use up to three
        stars for headlines.

          **Start a line with two stars to create a 4th level headline
          ***Start a line with three stars to create a 5th level headline.

    Lists and Tables
        Text::Hatena supports ordered and unordered lists. Start every line
        with a minus (-) for unordered lists or a plus (+) for ordered ones.
        More marks mean deeper levels. You can show the end of the lists by
        a blank line.

          -Start a line with minuses to create an unordered list item.

          +Start a line with pluses to create an ordered list item.
          ++They can be nested.

        Text::Hatena supports definition lists. Start every line with a
        colon followed by a term, a colon, and a description.

          :term:description

        You can create tables by using a simple syntax. Table rows have to
        start and end with a vertical bar (|). Separete every cell with a
        vertical bar (|). To turn cells into headers, begin them with a
        star.

          |*header1|*header2|
          |colum1|colum2|

    Blockquotes
        To make a blockquote, enclose line(s) with >> (double greater-than
        sign) and << (double less-than sign). Marks should be placed in
        separate lines; don't start quoting line(s) with >> or end them with
        <<. Blockquotes may be nested.

          >>
          To make a blockquote, enclose line(s) with >> (double greater-than sign)
          and << (double less-than sign).
          <<

    Preformatted texts
        To make a preformatted text, enclose line(s) with >| (a greater-than
        sign followed by a vertical bar) and |< (a vertical var followed by
        a less-than sign).

        Every >| should be placed in separate lines; don't start
        preformatted line(s) with >|. But some preformatted texts may be
        closed by |< after the last lines without separating lines.

          >|
          To make a preformatted text, enclose line(s) with >|
          (a greater-than sign followed by a vertical bar) and |<
          (a vertical var followed by a less-than sign).
          |<

        This also works well.

          >|
          To make a preformatted text, enclose line(s) with >|
          (a greater-than sign followed by a vertical bar) and |<
          (a vertical var followed by a less-than sign).|<

        To encode special characters into HTML entities, use >|| and ||< for
        >| and |<. The characters to be replaced are less-than signs (<),
        greater-than signs (>), double quotes ("), and ampersands (&).

          >||
          To encode special characters into HTML entities,
          use >|| and ||< for >| and |<.
          ||<
